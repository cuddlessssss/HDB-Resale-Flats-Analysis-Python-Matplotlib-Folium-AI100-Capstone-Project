## HDB Resale Flats Analysis | Python | Folium | Matplolib

This is the official Final Project for my AI100 Course at Heicoders Academy. A solo Project where I analysed HDB Resale Flats and found important correlations for analysis. Cleaning the data and prepared it to create meaningful visualisations later using Matplotlib for static ones and Folium imported for the geospatial mapping with latlongs.
